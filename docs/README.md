# Scientific Approach to life â˜˜

Often there are thing that we do in life, where we do not use science to understand it or make it better. For example, food - very less people know the science behind the working of "food". They learn by experience, which is often slow, as you cannot make connection to other fields, but if you use science you can use your earlier learned experiences. In this site I will present material related to basic things in life but in scientific manner. Doing things in scientific manner will help you to make stronger connections and you will not forget them.
